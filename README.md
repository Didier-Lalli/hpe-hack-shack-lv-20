# Welcome to HPE Discover Virtual Hack Shack

This repo contains the Jupyter Notebooks used for the Hack Shack Challenges during HPE Discover Virtual Experience.

We will propose the following challenges:

## The K8S Challenge: Deploy your app in a Kubernetes cluster

In this challenge, you’ll package an application in a container and create the necessary Kubernetes artifacts to publish it in a Kubernetes cluster managed by HPE Container Platform. The challenge will be considered successful when the app is up and running in that environment. You can use the application you developed in the Grommet Challenge, or we can provide you with one.
 
## Redfish Challenge: Use Redfish to streamline queries

In this challenge, you’ll leverage the Redfish REST API to create a scripted version of system information where you would list items, like devices and serial numbers, in a single query. You‘ll have a choice between using simple bash, PowerShell, or Python to achieve your goal.
 
## Grommet Challenge:  Design your App with Grommet Designer

In this challenge, you’ll learn what Grommet and Grommet Designer are and how to use them to easily design your own app. Start with a basic design supplied by Grommet Designer, generate code from your design, push it to GitHub, and deploy in Netlify. Use your design and coding skills to enhance the application. Beginner, expert designers and developers are all welcome.
 
## HPE OneView Challenge: Use PowerShell to code an API-based report

In this challenge, you’ll leverage the provided HPE OneView PowerShell library to create a PowerShell-coded API-based report that provides a list of relevant items. You’ll make use of a Jupyter notebook, a PowerShell kernel, some documentation, and a good deal of creativity!


Each challenge will have a winner, which we will announce at the end of HPE Discover Virtual Experience 2020.

Let's hack and have fun!
